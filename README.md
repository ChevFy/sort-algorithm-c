## Project Structure

| File / Folder | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `main.c` | Main program (driver) that runs different sorting algorithms |
| `sort/` | Folder containing algorithm files, e.g., Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Selection Sort, etc. |
| `sort/sort.h` | Header file containing all algorithm function declarations |
| `Makefile` | Used to build and clean the project |

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your machine
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ChevFy/sort-algorithm-c.git
   cd sort-algorithm-c
   ```

2. Compile the project
   ```bash
   make
   ```

   This will generate an executable file (named `main`).

3. Run the program
   ```bash
   ./main
   ```

4. Remove compiled files (clean)
   ```bash
   make clean
   ```
